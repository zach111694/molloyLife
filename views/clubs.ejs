                            Leadership, Education, and Awareness of Disabilities (L.E.A.D.) Club at Molloy College is dedicated to increasing awareness and mindfulness of disabilities by holding on-campus events and presentations for students, staff, and faculty. L.E.A.D. is open to any and all members of the student body who wish to help in this mission through attendance at meetings, contribution of ideas, and organization of events and presentations.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            L.E.A.D. has organized several events that are not only informational, but also engage the Molloy community in order to further increase the meaning of what it means to have a disability. Events such as Wheeling the Way (where students, staff, and faculty sign-up to use a wheelchair during their full day at Molloy) and Breakfast in the Dark (a spin-off of the popular Dinner in the Dark) give students, staff and faculty the ability to experience first-hand what it may be like to have certain disabilities.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It should be noted that the members of L.E.A.D. give some of the most breath-taking, and inspiring presentations. Several members of L.E.A.D. who have disabilities have volunteered on several occasions to share their very personal stories in hopes of providing accurate information on what life is like for a person with a disability. Presentations have spanned across several themes, including assistive technology, the transition from high school to college, and accommodations in higher education. Recently, several members of L.E.A.D. went to Baltimore, Maryland to present at the Association of Higher Education And Disability (AHEAD) conference, where their ideas and stories were widely and positively received.

                            The Molloy College Women's Rugby Football Club made their long-awaited debut in the Fall of
                            2008. After a small group of women, led by Margaret Ziminski, tried for many years to get a
                            club started. The fruits of their labor were finally recognized when the Class of 2012
                            arrived in Rockville Centre.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Under the direction of Scott Salvato and Brendan Droge, nearly 30 ladies were smashing
                            tackle bags and hitting the club's newly-purchased scrum machine within days of their
                            introduction to rugby.

                                Molloy College Women's Rugby made its debut on March 22, against a well-schooled Sacred
                                Heart University. Though the Pioneers "took the Lions to class" that day, a new chapter in the
                                history of Molloy College had been written. The Ladies in Maroon and White went winless in the
                                spring of 2009, but it certainly wasn't from lack of heart or passion for the game. Fall 2009
                                marked the Ruggettes from RVC's first Met Union league season. It wouldn't be long before the
                                ladies tasted their first league victory.

                            <br>
                                In the season's first two weekends, Molloy dismantled Bard and Drew by the scores of
                                73-0 and 39-0 respectively. Explosive offense and pulverizing defense instantly became
                                the Lady Lions' trademarks. Incredibly, the team would go on to secure a playoff berth
                                in their inaugural season! Despite losing to powerhouse Fairfield in the Met Union
                                Semifinals, Molloy had proven itself as a force to be reckoned with

                            MPAC was a revived club in 2011 by Ryan Lane.  The club consisted of 6 members at that time.
                            Now, our family has grown to have 40 plus members.  The main purpose of MPAC is to establish
                            a fun and creative environment for Molloy students to express their passion for the performing arts.
                            Each year, MPAC strives to put on at least 2 productions.  Our productions are fully run by
                            the students.  From the directing, acting, costume design, light design, sound, stage managers,
                            tech crew, choreography, musical pit members, programs, concessions and advertising,it's
                            almost entirely student-run and we pride ourselves on that.

                            offers an environment where all who are interested are welcome to meet, learn, and participate
                            in various psychology and counseling and community service activities.  Each month, we have
                            a club meeting and a special event. Some of these events include de-stress and healthy
                            thinking events, crepe sales, movie nights and participation in volunteer services such as
                            the walks for NAMI and Autism Speaks. Other events are focused on helping students who are
                            preparing to enter the fields of psychology and counseling. For example, we host a panel of
                            professionals and a Molloy psychology alumni meet and greet, both of which allow students to
                            learn from professionals and graduate students working in various fields of psychology and
                            counseling. Overall, our goal is to educate the campus about different opportunities in
                            psychology and counseling while forming a fellowship among students and faculty members.
