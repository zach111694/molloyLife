Though the Pioneers \"took the Lions to class\" that day, a new chapter in the history of Molloy College had been written. The Ladies in Maroon and White went winless in the spring of 2009, but it certainly wasn't from lack of heart or passion for the game.

It wouldn't be long before the ladies tasted their first league victory.<br><br>In the season's first two weekends, Molloy dismantled Bard and Drew by the scores of 73-0 and 39-0 respectively. Explosive offense and pulverizing defense instantly became the Lady Lions' trademarks. Incredibly, the team would go on to secure a playoff berth in their inaugural season! Despite losing to powerhouse Fairfield in the Met Union Semifinals, Molloy had proven itself as a force to be reckoned with"
